# Rabbit Escape(兔子大逃亡)
## 1.Introduction<a name="link"/>
"Rabbit Escape" is an H5 game made by the Cocos toolchain. Considering the purpose of why I made it,  that's because I intend to have a deep dive into the development pipeline of Cocos. Meanwhile, it's totally an open-source game. If you interest in knowing how to make it by yourself,  please check the URL of its ([tutorial](http://cn.cocos2d-x.org/tutorial/lists?id=135)).:)
